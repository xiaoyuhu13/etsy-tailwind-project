# Etsy-Tailwind-project

After reflecting on my past projects, I initiated the Etsy Tailwind project to work on my areas of growth on both the design and development sides.

Design goals addressed include understanding design systems and Figma prototyping. Development goals addressed include learning Tailwind CSS, creating a responsive website, and building my React skills. Currently I have finished the Figma prototype and responsive Tailwind buildout of the website, and am now working on my last goal of building my React skills by rewriting some repetitive html elements into reusable React components.
